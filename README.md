====================
GrooveDown DL + ExtJS
====================

Well, this project it's just a study of the `ExtJS <http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs>`_, fell free to fork, commit
and everything else.

I did this project because I had to made a project in `ExtJS <http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs>`_ in my company and
i didnt found so much things in ExtJS MVC, So I decided to do a example.

In other point, why i doesn't did a simple project, static...? Because my cousin told once: "Alexandre did you know
some tool to download musics in web easily?" So here we are, can't be more easy!

I searched and found a wonderful project to get the "GrooveShark API" `Python Grooveshark <https://github.com/koehlma/pygrooveshark>`_

As in the Python Grooveshark project says: "I am not responsible for any violations against the Grooveshark Terms of Service (It is not allowed to download music except for cache usage)"
This is just for education, it's not recomended put in some server and make a population happy, ok? :P
